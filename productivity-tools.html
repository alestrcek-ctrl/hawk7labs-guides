        <h2 id="why">💡 Why This Matters</h2>

        <p>Every day, you face the same invisible enemies: forgotten tasks, scattered information, weak passwords that put you at risk, and a calendar that controls you instead of serving you.</p>

        <p>The cost is real. That important email you forgot to send. The password you reused that got leaked. The goal you set in January that disappeared by February. The article you saved but never found again. These small failures compound into something bigger: a feeling that life is happening to you rather than being shaped by you.</p>

        <p>This guide is different from the hundreds of "productivity tool" articles online. We are not listing apps for you to download and forget. We are building a personal system - one layer at a time - that will fundamentally change how you capture, organize, and act on what matters.</p>

        <p>The goal is not to use more tools. The goal is to free your mind from trying to remember everything, so you can focus on thinking, creating, and living.</p>

        <h2>🏠 How This System Works</h2>

        <p>Think of your productivity system like a house:</p>

        <p><strong>🏗️ Foundation</strong> - You cannot build anything stable without this. Security and time awareness come first.</p>

        <p><strong>🧱 Structure</strong> - Once your foundation is solid, you add walls and rooms. This is where you organize your tasks and knowledge.</p>

        <p><strong>✨ Enhancement</strong> - Only after the house is standing do you add the finishing touches. Focus tools and learning accelerators come last.</p>

        <div class="warning">
            <strong>⚠️ Important:</strong> Most people fail because they start with the fancy tools and skip the foundation. Do not make that mistake. Master each level before moving to the next.
        </div>

        <hr>

        <h2 class="level" id="level1">🏗️ Level 1: Your Foundation</h2>
        <p>Start here. Do not skip this. These two tools protect you and give you awareness of your time.</p>

        <h3>🔐 Bitwarden - Secure Your Digital Life</h3>

        <h4>😰 The Problem</h4>
        <p>You probably use the same 3-5 passwords everywhere. Or you use variations like "Password1" and "Password2". You know this is dangerous, but creating and remembering unique passwords for 50+ accounts feels impossible.</p>

        <p>Here is the reality: data breaches happen constantly. When one company gets hacked, attackers take those leaked passwords and try them on every other site. If you use the same password for your email and some random forum you signed up for years ago, you are one breach away from losing access to everything.</p>

        <h4>❓ Why This Must Come First</h4>
        <p>Your passwords are the keys to your digital life. Your email, your bank, your social media, your work accounts - everything. A password manager is not a convenience tool. It is the foundation of your digital security. Without this, nothing else matters because one breach could undo everything.</p>

        <h4>✅ What Bitwarden Does</h4>
        <p>Bitwarden is a vault that stores all your passwords in one secure place. You remember one master password. Bitwarden remembers everything else. It also generates strong, unique passwords for every account - passwords like "x7#mK9$pL2@nQ" that no human could guess or remember.</p>

        <div class="example">
            <h4>📖 Real Example: The Password Audit</h4>
            <p>When you set up Bitwarden and import your existing passwords, it will show you something uncomfortable: how many of your passwords are weak, reused, or already appeared in known data breaches.</p>
            <p>One client discovered that her main email password had appeared in 3 separate data breaches. She had been using that same password for 8 years across dozens of accounts. Within one evening, she changed every compromised password to a unique, strong one - something that would have taken weeks of mental effort without a password manager.</p>
            <p>Now, when she creates a new account anywhere, she clicks one button. Bitwarden generates a 20-character random password, saves it, and auto-fills it whenever she returns. She has not typed a password manually in months.</p>
        </div>

        <h4>🛠️ How to Set Up Bitwarden</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to <a href="https://bitwarden.com" target="_blank">bitwarden.com</a></li>
            <li>Click "Get Started" and create your free account</li>
            <li>Choose a master password you can remember but others cannot guess
                <ul>
                    <li>Good: A sentence like "My-cat-Luna-was-born-in-2019"</li>
                    <li>Bad: Your birthday, pet name alone, or common words</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Install the browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, or Safari</li>
            <li>Install the mobile app on your phone</li>
            <li>Import your existing passwords from your browser (Bitwarden has guides for this)</li>
            <li>Over the next week, update your weakest passwords first (email, banking, social media)</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="action-box">
            <h4>🎯 Your First Action</h4>
            <p>Right now, open Bitwarden and check your "Vault Health Report" (in the web vault under Tools > Reports). See how many passwords are weak or reused. Pick the three most important accounts and change those passwords today.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>📅 Google Calendar - Own Your Time</h3>

        <h4>😰 The Problem</h4>
        <p>Time passes whether you pay attention to it or not. Most people operate reactively - responding to whatever feels urgent, saying yes to requests without checking what they are already committed to, and ending each week wondering where the time went.</p>

        <p>Without a clear view of your time, you cannot protect it. And if you cannot protect your time, you cannot make progress on what actually matters to you.</p>

        <h4>❓ Why This Must Come First</h4>
        <p>Your calendar is your map of reality. Not what you hope to do or what you should do - what is actually happening with your hours and days. Before you can organize tasks or learn new things, you need to see clearly where your time is going. A calendar also protects you from overcommitting - when you can see your week visually, you stop saying yes to things that do not fit.</p>

        <h4>✅ What Google Calendar Does</h4>
        <p>Google Calendar gives you a visual map of your time. But more importantly, it becomes a commitment device. When you block time for something, you are making a promise to yourself. When someone asks for your time, you can check if it actually fits instead of guessing.</p>

        <div class="example">
            <h4>📖 Real Example: The Time Audit</h4>
            <p>A coaching client felt constantly overwhelmed but could not explain why. She felt busy all the time but was not making progress on her important goals.</p>
            <p>We did a simple exercise: for one week, she logged everything she did in Google Calendar - not what she planned to do, but what actually happened. At the end of the week, she could see it clearly: 14 hours on social media, 6 hours in meetings that did not require her, 3 hours looking for things she had misplaced. Her "busy" feeling was real, but she was busy with the wrong things.</p>
            <p>Now she uses time blocking: every Sunday evening, she blocks 2-hour chunks for her most important work before anything else goes on the calendar. Those blocks are treated as sacred appointments with herself.</p>
        </div>

        <h4>🛠️ How to Set Up Google Calendar</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to <a href="https://calendar.google.com" target="_blank">calendar.google.com</a> and sign in with your Google account</li>
            <li>Take 15 minutes to add your existing commitments for this week</li>
            <li>Create color-coded categories:
                <ul>
                    <li>🔴 Red: Non-negotiable commitments (work meetings, appointments)</li>
                    <li>🔵 Blue: Personal important time (exercise, family, rest)</li>
                    <li>🟢 Green: Growth activities (learning, coaching, projects)</li>
                    <li>⚪ Gray: Flexible/optional activities</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Block your recurring commitments first (sleep time, work hours, weekly meetings)</li>
            <li>Set default reminders: 1 day before and 30 minutes before events</li>
            <li>Share your calendar with family or close collaborators if needed</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>⏰ Time Blocking: The Key Practice</h4>
        <p>Time blocking means putting your important work on the calendar before other things fill the space. Here is how:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Every Sunday evening (15 minutes), review the week ahead</li>
            <li>Identify your 3 most important tasks for the week</li>
            <li>Find 2-hour blocks where you will work on each one</li>
            <li>Put these on your calendar with specific labels ("Write quarterly report", not "Work")</li>
            <li>Treat these blocks like medical appointments - do not cancel for something "urgent"</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="action-box">
            <h4>🎯 Your First Action</h4>
            <p>Open Google Calendar right now. Block 2 hours tomorrow for your single most important task this week. Set a reminder for 30 minutes before. Tomorrow, when that reminder appears, honor the commitment you made to yourself.</p>
        </div>

        <hr>

        <h2 class="level" id="level2">📂 Level 2: Your Organization Layer</h2>
        <p>Only move here after you have used Bitwarden and Google Calendar consistently for at least two weeks. Adding more tools before building habits will create chaos, not clarity.</p>

        <h3>🤔 Choosing Your Organization Tool</h3>

        <p>You need a place to capture tasks and information. But you do not need both Todoist AND Notion. Choose one based on how your mind works:</p>

        <p><strong>Choose Todoist if:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>You think in tasks and deadlines</li>
            <li>You want simplicity over flexibility</li>
            <li>You prefer checking boxes and seeing progress</li>
            <li>You get overwhelmed by too many options</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Choose Notion if:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>You think in notes and connections</li>
            <li>You want to build a personal knowledge system</li>
            <li>You like customizing your workspace</li>
            <li>You process information by writing</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Read both sections below, then commit to one tool for at least 30 days before reconsidering.</p>

        <h3>✅ Todoist - Capture and Complete Your Tasks</h3>

        <h4>😰 The Problem</h4>
        <p>Your brain is terrible at remembering tasks. It will remind you about the email you need to send at 3am when you cannot do anything about it, then completely forget when you are sitting at your computer. This creates two problems: anxiety (your brain keeps churning on open loops) and failure (important things slip through the cracks).</p>

        <h4>❓ Why This Matters</h4>
        <p>David Allen, who created the Getting Things Done methodology, explains it simply: "Your brain is for having ideas, not holding them." Every task you try to remember occupies mental bandwidth. A trusted task system lets you capture everything and free your mind for actual thinking. The key word is "trusted" - you must review it regularly and know that nothing important is forgotten.</p>

        <h4>✅ What Todoist Does</h4>
        <p>Todoist is a simple, fast task manager. You add tasks, set due dates, and Todoist reminds you at the right time. Nothing more, nothing less. This simplicity is its strength - there is no learning curve, no complex features to master, just reliable task capture and completion.</p>

        <div class="example">
            <h4>📖 Real Example: The Brain Dump</h4>
            <p>A client felt paralyzed by everything he needed to do. His to-do list lived in his head, on sticky notes, in emails marked unread, and in texts he had not replied to. He could never relax because something was always nagging at him.</p>
            <p>We spent 30 minutes doing a brain dump: he said everything on his mind out loud while I typed it into Todoist. We captured 67 tasks. Just the act of getting them out of his head and into a trusted system created immediate relief. His brain could finally stop the endless rehearsal.</p>
            <p>Then we added due dates. Some tasks were truly urgent. Most were not. By the end, he could see clearly: only 8 things actually needed attention this week. The rest could wait. For the first time in months, he knew exactly what to focus on.</p>
        </div>

        <h4>🛠️ How to Set Up Todoist</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to <a href="https://todoist.com" target="_blank">todoist.com</a> and create a free account</li>
            <li>Install the mobile app on your phone</li>
            <li>Do a brain dump: spend 15 minutes adding every task on your mind
                <ul>
                    <li>Do not organize yet - just get everything out</li>
                    <li>Include small things ("buy toothpaste") and big things ("plan vacation")</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Create 3-5 projects for different areas of your life:
                <ul>
                    <li>Work</li>
                    <li>Personal</li>
                    <li>Health</li>
                    <li>Learning</li>
                    <li>Someday/Maybe (for ideas you might do later)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Go through your brain dump and assign each task to a project</li>
            <li>Add due dates only to tasks that truly have deadlines</li>
            <li>Mark tasks without real deadlines as "No date" - you will review them weekly</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>🔄 The Weekly Review Ritual</h4>
        <p>Todoist only works if you trust it. Trust comes from regular review.</p>
        <p>Every Sunday (15 minutes):</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Process your inbox - any uncategorized tasks get a project and date</li>
            <li>Review this week's completed tasks (celebrate progress)</li>
            <li>Review overdue tasks - reschedule or delete them honestly</li>
            <li>Look at the week ahead - are your commitments realistic?</li>
            <li>Add any new tasks that emerged during the week</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="action-box">
            <h4>🎯 Your First Action</h4>
            <p>Set a timer for 15 minutes. Open Todoist and brain dump everything on your mind. Do not stop to organize - just capture. When the timer ends, you will feel lighter. Tomorrow, you can organize what you captured.</p>

        <h3>📝 Notion - Build Your Personal Knowledge System</h3>

        <h4>😰 The Problem</h4>
        <p>Information enters your life constantly: articles you read, ideas you have, notes from meetings, things you learn. Most of it disappears. You save articles you never read again. You have notebooks filled with notes you cannot find. Your insights from books fade within weeks. This scattered information creates a frustrating paradox: you consume more than ever but retain and use almost nothing.</p>

        <h4>❓ Why This Matters</h4>
        <p>Your brain is excellent at making connections but terrible at storage. The most creative people are not those with the best memory - they are those with the best systems for capturing and retrieving ideas. Notion lets you build a "second brain" where your knowledge compounds over time instead of evaporating.</p>

        <h4>✅ What Notion Does</h4>
        <p>Notion is a flexible workspace that adapts to how you think. It can be a simple note-taking app or a complex personal database. You can create pages within pages, link ideas together, and build a personal wiki of everything you know and learn. Unlike traditional note apps, Notion helps you connect information, not just store it.</p>

        <div class="example">
            <h4>📖 Real Example: The Coaching Archive</h4>
            <p>A client had been working with coaches and therapists for years but felt like she was covering the same ground repeatedly. Insights from previous sessions were trapped in scattered notebooks or forgotten entirely.</p>
            <p>She started a simple Notion system: after each coaching session, she spent 10 minutes capturing key insights, questions that emerged, and action items. She linked related concepts across sessions. After six months, she had built a searchable archive of her personal growth journey.</p>
            <p>Something powerful emerged: patterns became visible. She could see that the same fear had appeared in 7 different sessions, wearing different disguises. She could trace how a belief from childhood was affecting her decisions at work. The archive became a mirror showing her things she could not see in any single session.</p>
        </div>

        <h4>🛠️ How to Set Up Notion</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to <a href="https://notion.so" target="_blank">notion.so</a> and create a free account</li>
            <li>Start with a clean workspace - resist the urge to add everything immediately</li>
            <li>Create these four foundational pages:
                <ul>
                    <li>📥 Inbox: Quick capture for any thought or idea</li>
                    <li>🏠 Areas: Ongoing areas of your life (Health, Career, Relationships, Growth)</li>
                    <li>🎯 Projects: Active projects with specific outcomes</li>
                    <li>📦 Archive: Completed projects and old notes</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Start using the Inbox immediately for any thought worth capturing</li>
            <li>Once a week, process your Inbox:
                <ul>
                    <li>Actionable items go to your task manager</li>
                    <li>Reference information gets filed in the relevant Area</li>
                    <li>Ideas for projects go to Projects or a "Someday" list</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>🔗 The Connection Practice</h4>
        <p>Notion's power comes from linking ideas. Whenever you add a new note:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Ask: What does this relate to that I already know?</li>
            <li>Add links to 2-3 related notes</li>
            <li>If you notice a pattern across multiple notes, create a new page explaining the pattern</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Over time, you stop having isolated notes. You have a connected web of your own thinking.</p>

        <div class="action-box">
            <h4>🎯 Your First Action</h4>
            <p>Create your Notion account and make one page: "Inbox". For the next week, every time you have a thought worth keeping - an idea, something you learned, something you want to remember - add it to your Inbox. Do not organize yet. Just capture. After one week, you will have raw material to start building your system.</p>
        </div>

        <hr>

        <h2 class="level" id="level3">🚀 Level 3: Your Enhancement Layer</h2>
        <p>These tools amplify your effectiveness, but only if your foundation and organization layers are solid. Adding these too early is like buying running shoes before you have learned to walk.</p>

        <h3>📚 NotebookLM - Accelerate Your Learning</h3>

        <h4>😰 The Problem</h4>
        <p>You have more information available than any human in history, but limited time to absorb it. A single book contains months of an author's thinking. A research paper represents years of work. You cannot possibly read everything relevant to your interests and goals. But you also cannot afford to miss key insights that could change your thinking.</p>

        <h4>❓ Why This Matters</h4>
        <p>Learning is not about consuming more content. It is about extracting insights and connecting them to what you already know. NotebookLM lets you have a conversation with any document - asking questions, requesting summaries, exploring connections. It is like having a research assistant who has read everything you need to read.</p>

        <h4>✅ What NotebookLM Does</h4>
        <p>NotebookLM is Google's AI-powered research tool. You upload documents - PDFs, articles, YouTube videos, Google Docs - and it creates an AI that has "read" everything. You can then ask questions, request summaries, or explore connections across all your sources. Unlike ChatGPT, which knows general information, NotebookLM knows specifically what is in your documents.</p>

        <div class="example">
            <h4>📖 Real Example: The Book Accelerator</h4>
            <p>A client had 12 books on his "must read" list but was making no progress. Each book felt like a multi-week commitment he could not afford.</p>
            <p>He tried a new approach with NotebookLM. He uploaded the first book (a PDF) and started with this question: "What are the 3-5 most important ideas in this book that would be valuable for someone trying to improve their leadership?"</p>
            <p>NotebookLM extracted the core concepts with specific page references. He spent 30 minutes reading just those sections in depth. Then he asked follow-up questions: "How does the author suggest implementing the concept from chapter 4?" and "What are the common objections to these ideas?"</p>
            <p>In two hours, he had extracted more actionable insight than most people get from reading the entire book. He repeated this process for three more books that week. His backlog transformed from a source of guilt into a source of growth.</p>

        <h4>💬 Powerful Questions to Ask NotebookLM</h4>

        <p><strong>📚 For Books:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>"What are the 5 most actionable insights from this book?"</li>
            <li>"Summarize chapter X in 3 key points with supporting quotes"</li>
            <li>"What would the author say about [your specific situation]?"</li>
            <li>"What are the counterarguments to the main thesis?"</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>🔬 For Research:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>"Compare how these sources approach [topic]"</li>
            <li>"What do all these sources agree on? Where do they disagree?"</li>
            <li>"What evidence is strongest for [claim]? What evidence is weakest?"</li>
            <li>"What questions are these sources not addressing?"</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>🎓 For Learning:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>"Explain [concept] as if I have no background in this field"</li>
            <li>"Create 10 questions to test my understanding of this material"</li>
            <li>"What real-world examples illustrate [concept]?"</li>
            <li>"How does [concept A] relate to [concept B]?"</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="action-box">
            <h4>🎯 Your First Action</h4>
            <p>Choose one book or long article you have been meaning to read but have not had time for. Upload it to NotebookLM. Ask: "What are the three most important ideas in this source, and why do they matter?" Then follow up with questions about anything that interests you. In 20 minutes, you will have extracted insights that would take hours of traditional reading.</p>

        <h3>🌳 Forest - Protect Your Focus</h3>

        <h4>😰 The Problem</h4>
        <p>Your phone is engineered by thousands of brilliant people whose job is to capture and hold your attention. Every notification, every red badge, every infinite scroll is designed to pull you away from what you intended to do. Willpower alone is not enough. You are fighting against billions of dollars of attention-capture technology.</p>

        <p>The cost is severe. Deep work - the kind of concentrated effort that produces your best thinking and highest-value output - requires extended periods of uninterrupted focus. Every context switch costs you 15-25 minutes of recovery time. If you check your phone every 20 minutes, you never actually reach deep focus. You spend your days in the shallow end.</p>

        <h4>❓ Why This Matters</h4>
        <p>Your ability to focus deeply is becoming rare and therefore increasingly valuable. Cal Newport calls this "deep work" - the ability to focus without distraction on cognitively demanding tasks. Most people have lost this ability. Those who protect it will outperform in any field that requires thinking. Focus is not just about productivity - it is about the quality of your life and work.</p>

        <h4>✅ What Forest Does</h4>
        <p>Forest turns focus into a game. You plant a virtual tree and set a timer. If you leave the app to check social media or other distractions, your tree dies. Complete the session and your tree grows. Over time, you build a forest that represents hours of focused work. It sounds simple, but the gamification changes your relationship with distraction.</p>

        <div class="example">
            <h4>📖 Real Example: The Focus Transformation</h4>
            <p>A client tracked her phone usage and discovered she was picking up her phone 80+ times per day, often without any conscious intention. She would reach for it during any moment of boredom or difficulty - exactly when she should have been pushing through to deeper thinking.</p>
            <p>She started using Forest for her morning work block: 90 minutes with no phone access. The first week was uncomfortable. She noticed physical urges to check her phone every few minutes. But she did not want to kill her tree.</p>
            <p>By week three, something shifted. The urges became less frequent. She started experiencing states of deep focus she had not felt since before smartphones. Her morning 90 minutes became her most productive time - she accomplished more in that protected window than in the rest of the day combined.</p>
            <p>Her forest now shows over 200 hours of focused time. Each tree represents a period where she chose her own priorities over the demands of her phone.</p>
        </div>

        <h4>🛠️ How to Set Up Forest</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Download Forest from the App Store (iPhone) or Play Store (Android)</li>
            <li>Open the app and set your first tree: start with 25 minutes</li>
            <li>Choose a tree type (you unlock more as you earn coins from completed sessions)</li>
            <li>Tap to start planting</li>
            <li>Put your phone face-down and work</li>
            <li>When the timer ends, return to see your tree</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>🎯 The Focus Protocol</h4>

        <p><strong>⏱️ Before starting:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Define exactly what you will work on (not "do work" but "write introduction to report")</li>
            <li>Clear your physical workspace</li>
            <li>Close unnecessary browser tabs on your computer</li>
            <li>Put phone in another room or face-down with Forest running</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>⏰ Session lengths:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>🌱 Beginner: 25 minutes on, 5 minutes break (Pomodoro technique)</li>
            <li>🌿 Intermediate: 50 minutes on, 10 minutes break</li>
            <li>🌳 Advanced: 90 minutes on, 20 minutes break (matches natural focus cycles)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>✅ After completing:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Review what you accomplished</li>
            <li>Note any insights or next steps</li>
            <li>Take your break completely (do not check phone - go outside, stretch, or rest your eyes)</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="action-box">
            <h4>🎯 Your First Action</h4>
            <p>Download Forest. Right now, set a 25-minute timer and work on your single most important task. Do not check your phone until the tree is complete. Notice how it feels to give something your full attention. This is what you have been missing.</p>

        <h2 id="system">🔗 Putting It All Together</h2>

        <h3>⚙️ How These Tools Work as a System</h3>

        <p>These tools are not separate apps. They form an integrated system:</p>

        <p><strong>🔐 Bitwarden</strong> secures everything else. Without it, a breach could lock you out of all your other tools.</p>

        <p><strong>📅 Google Calendar</strong> shows you what is real - your actual commitments and available time.</p>

        <p><strong>✅ Todoist/Notion</strong> captures what needs to happen and what you are learning.</p>

        <p><strong>📚 NotebookLM</strong> accelerates your learning when you need to absorb information quickly.</p>

        <p><strong>🌳 Forest</strong> protects the time you block for important work.</p>

        <p>The flow looks like this:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>You identify an important task</li>
            <li>You block time on your calendar</li>
            <li>You add supporting tasks to Todoist or capture research in Notion</li>
            <li>When that blocked time arrives, you start Forest and do the work</li>
            <li>If you need to learn something, you use NotebookLM to accelerate</li>
            <li>Everything is secured by Bitwarden</li>
        </ol>

        <hr>

        <h2 id="plan">📅 Your Implementation Plan</h2>

        <p>Do not try to set up everything at once. That leads to abandoned tools and wasted effort. Follow this sequence:</p>

        <p><strong>📆 Week 1: Security Foundation</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Day 1: Set up Bitwarden, import existing passwords</li>
            <li>Day 2-3: Change your 5 most important passwords (email, banking, etc.)</li>
            <li>Day 4-7: Change passwords as you log into sites naturally</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>📆 Week 2: Time Foundation</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Day 1: Set up Google Calendar, add existing commitments</li>
            <li>Day 2-3: Practice time blocking - block 2 hours each day for important work</li>
            <li>Day 4-7: Refine your system, add color coding, set up weekly review time</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>📆 Week 3-4: Build the Habit</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use only Bitwarden and Calendar for two weeks</li>
            <li>Do your weekly reviews consistently</li>
            <li>Notice what is working and what needs adjustment</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>📆 Week 5: Add Organization</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Choose Todoist OR Notion (not both)</li>
            <li>Do the brain dump or inbox capture</li>
            <li>Set up your projects/areas</li>
            <li>Start the weekly review ritual</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>📆 Week 6-8: Build the Habit</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use your foundation + organization tool consistently</li>
            <li>Refine your system based on what you learn</li>
            <li>Do not add anything new</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>📆 Week 9+: Add Enhancement (Only If Needed)</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you need to learn faster: add NotebookLM</li>
            <li>If focus is a problem: add Forest</li>
            <li>Add one tool at a time, not both</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>

        <p><strong>❌ Starting with too many tools.</strong> Each new tool requires mental energy to learn and maintain. Fewer tools, used consistently, beat many tools used poorly.</p>

        <p><strong>❌ Skipping the weekly review.</strong> Your system only works if you trust it. Trust comes from regular review. Missing reviews leads to abandoned systems.</p>

        <p><strong>❌ Treating tools as solutions.</strong> A task manager does not complete your tasks. A calendar does not protect your time. You do. Tools support your decisions but cannot replace them.</p>

        <p><strong>❌ Optimizing before using.</strong> Resist the urge to create the perfect setup before you start. Use the tools simply for a month, then refine based on actual experience.</p>

        <p><strong>❌ Adding tools before building habits.</strong> Master each layer before moving to the next. A solid foundation with two tools beats a shaky structure with six.</p>
